This data analyzes influenza infection rates over multiple years, focusing on seasonal and temperature-based factors. Key metrics include average infection rates, correlation with temperature, and the distribution of infection severity. Infection Rates Scores are determined based on the standard deviation from the average infection rate during non-influenza seasons, where a score of 1.0 a percentage population that is less than one standard deviation below the mean; a score of 2.0 is less than one standard deviation above the mean and scales to a score of 13.0 which is 20 standard deviations above the mean. A summary dashboard includes an interactive look on the distriubution of infection rates based on year (2020-2023)

Key Findings include details on: 
1. Yearly Infection Rates
2. Seasonal Effect on Infection Rates
3. Discussion of potential Additional Research
